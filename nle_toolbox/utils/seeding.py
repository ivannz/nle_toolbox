    Details
    -------
    Some facts about `cNethack` gathered from the apparent behaviour and a dive
    into its cpp code in `win/rl/pynethack.cc`

        * [set_initial_seeds](win/rl/pynethack.cc#L193) uses the provided seeds
        to generate the entire game and determine the future gameplay chaos
        until [the next](win/rl/pynethack.cc#L260) call to
        [reset(FILE *)](win/rl/pynethack.cc#L249).

        * [set_seeds](win/rl/pynethack.cc#L206) affects the _current_ state of
        the internal generator by calling [nle_set_seed](src/nle.c#L469)

        * [get_seeds](win/rl/pynethack.cc#L218) returns the seeds of
        the [current](win/rl/pynethack.cc#L226) chaos generator using
        [nle_get_seed](src/nle.c#L483), ONLY after the env has been reset
        at [least once](win/rl/pynethack.cc#L221).

    Procedures in `src/nle.c` are not even compiled if `NLE_ALLOW_SEEDING`
    (`nle.nethack.NLE_ALLOW_SEEDING`) macro def is not set. The procs in
    `win/rl/pynethack.cc` raise a std-lib's runtime error instead. Line
    numbers are valid as of commit `ce577cb1c` of nle's official github repo.

    Warning
    -------
    Although this makes the observation sequences deterministically dependent
    on the actions, taken in the env, it is possible that certain non-critical
    fields in the observation dict deviate between even seeded runs if the same
    instance of the Nethack env is reused. Namely, the fields `tty_chars`,
    `tty_colors` and `tty_cursor` might deviate due to the cursor location
    in the emulated tty terminal. Other fields, most importantly, `glyphs`,
    `message` and `inv_*` are identical.
