class OptionWrapper(Wrapper):
    """Temporal Abstraction Wrapper with atomic composite actions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    env : gym.Env
        The environment which to apply temporal abstraction to.

    reduce : callable, default=sum
        The callable which takes a list of rewards (floats or arrays, if
        the env has vector rewards) and computes and aggregate reward.
        By default we sum whatever rewards were tracked.

    allow_empty : bool, default=False
        Whether to allow empty options, i.e. those which refuse to execute
        any actions even on initialization.

    Details
    -------
    Actions of this particular wrapper are policies, implemented as python
    generators, that communicate low-level simple of composite actions to
    the wrapped environment via `yield` statements like this:

    ```python
        def policy(obs, hx=None):
            # note that the core decides when to cease
            action, halt, hx = core(obs, hx=hx)

        Design Considerations
        ---------------------
        A neat idea is to use `.step`-granular timer to schedule the manager's
        (the downstream user) next inspection, during which it checks if the
        control currently held by the running option should be transferred to
        another option. This requires the user to communicate a parameter,
        which specifies the number of steps until the next event.

        The complications came from deciding what determines this timeout. On
        the one hand, the supervisor decides when and what to run, hence should
        be able to set the time slice. This protects against malicious/faulty
        options, whose policy ramps the slice so high as to effectively make it
        hold exclusive control. On the other hand, the option's policy's inner
        logic `knows` better how often it can be polled for inspection. In
        addition, from responsibility separation standpoint, the supervisor
        could not know the acceptable polling interval better than the option
        itself. Besides, since the manager takes policies from a trusted source,
        it might be reasonable to assume cooperation between policies, meaning
        that a policy yields back control as soon as exclusive control becomes
        non-critical. This leaves faulty policies, which for some reason fail
        to halt.

        Long before considering the interruptions it was decided that besides
        simple actions options' policies may communicate composite actions, i.e.
        short sequences of instructions that are to be executed consecutively
        disregarding feedback from the environment (open-loop control), e.g.
        atomically. Since the policy inherently decides the atomicity of its
        actions, it seems reasonable to postpone the supervisor's inspection
        events until the current action has been executed in its entirety. For
        example, if an option is low priority, i.e. allows interruption and
        considers it highly likely, then it can opt in for the finest-grained
        supervision by issuing simple actions (singleton).

        Thus it was decided that the instruction sequence of an action
        determines the number of steps until next inspection.
